Decription:
Given any positive integer N, you are supposed to find all of its prime factors, and write them in the format N = p~1~\^k~1~ * p~2~\^k~2~ *…*p~m~\^k~m~.

Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case which gives a positive integer N in the range of long int.

Output Specification:
Factor N in the format N = p~1~\^k~1~ * p~2~\^k~2~ *…*p~m~\^k~m~, where p~i~'s are prime factors of N in increasing order, and the exponent k~i~ is the number of p~i~ -- hence when there is only one p~i~, k~i~ is 1 and must NOT be printed out.

Sample Input:
97532468

Sample Output:
97532468=2^2*11*17*101*1291
